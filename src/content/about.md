# Music Lessons
I teach from North East Valley Dunedin, with times available during the day and evenings, weekends on enquiry. Pricing available on request.

Some instrument hire options available.

Scratch the itch and come try it out! I hope to provide a fun, comfortable and encouraging environment for the learner and their aims, supported by a strong technical foundation.
Beginner and beyond, all ages.
